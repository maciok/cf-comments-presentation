== Conditions as comments
image::resources/top-left-image.png[background, size=25%, position=0% 0%]

Often, sections of code work only if certain conditions are true.
This may be as simple as a square root calculation only working on a positive input value.

Such assumptions are often not stated but can only be deduced by looking through an algorithm.

Sometimes, the assumptions are stated with a comment. A better technique is to make the assumption explicit by writing an assertion.

== A comment that should clarify behaviour
image::resources/top-left-image.png[background, size=25%, position=0% 0%]

A heuristic we follow is that whenever we feel the need to comment something, we write a function instead.

Such a function contains the code that we wanted to comment but is named after the intention of the code rather than the way it works.
We may do this on a group of lines or even on a single line of code. We do this even if the method call is longer than the code it replaces—provided the method name explains the purpose of the code.
The key here is not function length but the semantic distance between what the method does and how it does it.

== General rule before writing a comment
image::resources/top-left-image.png[background, size=25%, position=0% 0%]

If you need a comment to explain what a block of code does, try Extract Function.

If the method is already extracted but you still need a comment to explain what it does, use Change Function Declaration to rename it.

If you need to state some rules about the required state of the system, use Introduce Assertion.

Nothing can be quite so helpful as a well-placed comment.

Nothing can clutter up a module more than frivolous dogmatic comments.

Nothing can be quite so damaging as an old crufty comment that propagates lies and misinformation.

== Clean code view on comments
image::resources/top-left-image.png[background, size=25%, position=0% 0%]

It is possible to make the point that programmers should be disciplined enough to keep the comments in a high state of repair, relevance, and accuracy.

I agree, they should. But I would rather that energy go toward making the code so clear and expressive that it does not need the comments in the first place.

== Some valid comments

[source, java]
 // format matched kk:mm:ss EEE, MMM dd, yyyy
Pattern timeMatcher = Pattern.compile(“\\d*:\\d*:\\d* \\w*, \\w* \\d*, \\d*”);

In this case the comment lets us know that the regular expression is intended to match a time and date that were formatted with the SimpleDateFormat.format function using the specified format string.
Still, it might have been better, and clearer, if this code had been moved to a special class that converted the formats of dates and times.
Then the comment would likely have been superfluous.

== How to change comments defining abbreviation to enum
image::resources/top-left-image.png[background, size=25%, position=0% 0%]

Sometimes (often when you have to integrate with 3rd party system) we have to use some kind of static/hardcoded values that means noting to us or they are abbreviation.
In such cases it is useful to create enums with meaningful names and as a field use abbreviation.

[source, java]
enum OperationType {
  POS("NCP"),
  CLOSE("CLA"),
  MERGE("MLA"),
  UNKNOWN("");
}
